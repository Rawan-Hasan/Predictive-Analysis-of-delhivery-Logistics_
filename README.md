# Predictive-Analysis-of-delhivery-Logistics_
Problem Statement: Delhivery is one of the fastest growing logistics firm in India providing reliable transportation to various segments of the economy ranging from retail customers to ecommerce giants. They aim to build state of the art operations and gain competitive advanyage by minimising delivery time and achieving maximum efficiency in logistics.

Using this dataset, the firm wants to find opportunities to improve efficiency in operations and understand how the estimated delivery time/distance varies with respect to the actual delivery time/distance.
# Project Overview
This repository contains a Business Intelligence project focused on enhancing the logistics efficiency of Delhivery, a prominent supply chain services company in India. The goal is to analyze delivery data, clean and preprocess it, and build an Machine Learning that provides insights into trip efficiency, route optimization, transportation types, and overall delivery performance.

# Objectives
1-Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensure the data is accurate and consistent, by handling missing values and extracting key features.
2-Trip Efficiency Analysis: Identify patterns in trip durations and delivery times.
3-Route Optimization Insights: Evaluate the efficiency of delivery routes and suggest improvements.
4-Delivery Performance Metrics: Track delivery KPIs like on-time rate, delays, and average delivery time.
5-Support for Forecasting: Provide cleaned data and insights for building accurate forecasting models.

# Steps to Follow:

1. Load the Dataset:
   - Load the raw dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Review the data to understand its structure (columns, data types, missing values, etc.).
   - Save the dataset in a structured format (CSV/Excel) if necessary.

2. Handle Missing Values:
   - Identify columns with missing values and determine appropriate strategies for handling them:
     - Numeric Columns: Fill missing values with mean/median or flag them for imputation.
     - Categorical Columns: Replace missing values with the mode or create a 'missing' category if needed.
     - Remove records with excessive missing data (optional).

3. Correct Data Types:
   - Ensure that each column has the correct data type:
     - Dates: Convert any date-related columns to `datetime` format.
     - Numeric Values: Convert any relevant columns (e.g., distances, times, costs) to appropriate numeric types (e.g., `float`, `int`).
     - Categorical Values: Convert relevant columns (e.g., transportation types) to `category` type.

4. Feature Engineering:
   - Trip Duration: Create a new feature for the time taken for each trip by calculating the difference between start and end times.
   - Distance Covered: If applicable, derive a feature for the distance traveled during each trip.
   - Day of the Week/Month: Extract the day of the week or month from the date fields to analyze trends by time period.

5. Outlier Detection and Handling:
   - Detect any outliers in numerical data (e.g., unusually long trip durations or extremely short distances).
   - Handle outliers by either removing them or flagging them for further investigation.

6. Sanitize and Normalize Data:
   - Standardize column names to follow a consistent format (e.g., `trip_duration`, `delivery_time`, etc.).
   - Normalize numeric columns to a consistent scale (if needed) for better analysis.
